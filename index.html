        <strong>Interview format:</strong> In-Person on December 12, 2025
        <br>
        <strong>Interviewee name:</strong> Buck Kimbriel
        <br>
        <strong>Company name:</strong> Sketchy

      <p> 
        <strong>Here are the questions I asked during the interview:</strong> 
        <br>
        1) Can you give a short description of your career journey? 
        How did you get into your current role, and what experiences were most valuable in preparing you for it?
        What does a typical day or week look like in your position?
        <br>
        2) What did you think about the interview process for your current position? 
        What were the key moments and what general ideas do you believe they tested you on? 
        Was there anything that caught you off guard during the interview process?
        <br>
        3) Has this job changed what you want professionally in any noticeable way?
        <br>
        4) Personally, I deal with some of my own challenges in computer science. 
        What do you wish you had known when you were starting out in tech? 
        What advice would you give to students, or anyone else, preparing to enter the field?
        <br>
        5) Lastly, are there things you prioritize differently in your life now than you did when you first started in tech?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
        <br>
        My interview with Buck revealed important insights about building a sustainable career in frontend development. 
        Buck's career journey, from building WordPress templates in high school to navigating both chaotic startups and 
        larger corporations, demonstrated that early struggles and mistakes can be the most valuable learning experiences, 
        even when they're uncomfortable. His emphasis on learning systems design, data structures, and algorithms alongside 
        feature development was a key takeaway and mentioned that he regretted avoiding these fundamentals for too long in 
        favor of moving fast. Buck gave me some advice to “find your why” and it resonated with me. He explained that his 
        intrinsic motivation to build things from zero to one sustains him through inevitable frustrations, and that having 
        this anchor is crucial in tech's constantly evolving landscape. I also learned that the interview processes for jobs 
        vary widely (from his experience), from whiteboard pseudocode algorithms to practical feature-building exercises, and 
        that his preference for smaller teams stems from valuing decision-making freedom over the corporate layers. This 
        conversation connects directly to my professional development by reinforcing that I should balance immediate web skills 
        with foundational computer science knowledge, identify what genuinely fuels my passion in tech, and prioritize sustainable 
        work-life balance early rather than falling into the trap of feeling perpetually behind in the tech world.
