    <h1>Assignment 2 Testing your Understanding</h1>
    <p>Something I find interesting recently is the positive mental impact that comes with playing golf. Most people may consider the sport to be a physical game, but 
        there is much more to just <strong>swinging a golf club.</strong> Many factors play a role in getting that <strong>Perfect Swing</strong> such as your grip, backswing, 
        stance, form, and even what clubs and grips you are using! Because there are so many techniques that someone must know to properly play golf, I find it to be rather soothing. 
        Using the sport as an outlet from the outside world is my form of therapy. And I have also developed a love-hate relationship with the game of golf! <br />
